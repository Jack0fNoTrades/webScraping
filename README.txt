To scrape websites, put urls(one per line) in the file urls.txt and run the file scraper.py.
The program will generate one txt file per url that contains un-formatted data.
You can scrape any website but only the data from BizBuySell and Flippa are formatted and output to an Excel file.
You can scrape data from multiple pages of the same site by copy-pasting the url to the input file. The data will go into the same output file.
